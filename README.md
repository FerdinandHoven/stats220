## Purpose of repository
Now if you're like me you're wondering why I've set up this repository,
and theres three main reasons:
1. It was in my project requirements
2. I will *presumably* be instructed to use it for future projects and such
3. I **do not** want to get a bad grade!

## About the author
Some things about me! I am considered to be:
- ~~iconic~~
- ~~prodigal~~
- ~~one of the greatest minds of the century~~
- very humble

I also absolutely love climbing, particularly bouldering. If you want to get some insight into why I think bouldering is so sick, I highly recommend checking out 
[Wedge climbing](https://www.youtube.com/@WEDGECLIMBING), and in particular their [mini doc on Aidan Roberts.](https://youtu.be/zilINHowP2g?si=NTWvHNw1PhDKJcmJ)
